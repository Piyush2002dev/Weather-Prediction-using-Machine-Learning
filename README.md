Abstract
Accurate weather forecasting is imperative across various sectors, impacting decisions in agriculture, transportation, and emergency planning. Conventional methods often struggle with the intricate patterns in weather data, limiting accuracy. In this study, we harness the power of machine learning to address these challenges and enhance the precision and reliability of weather predictions. Our main contribution lies in leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze weather data effectively, aiming for superior accuracy compared to traditional methods. Through this approach, we strive to create a weather forecast model that offers more dependable predictions, thereby facilitating informed decision-making in diverse industries and daily life.
